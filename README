meta-oracle-java
================

This is a layer providing recipes for Oracle java packages. These are
generated from Oracle's publically released binary java packages.

The Oracle Java files are released by Oracle under "Oracle Binary Code License
Agreement for Java SE" license.

More information about license: 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/documentation/java-se-bcl-license-430205.html
or 
http://www.oracle.com/

These recipes will not build by default. In order to build them you need to
enable "oracle-java" license by adding this line in your local.conf

LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST += "oracle_java"

Notes
=====
The download URLs mentioned in the SRCURI of the oracle-java recipes
may show fetch issues with the built in bitbake wget fetcher. This is caused
by the pre-requirement of clicking the "accept license" button on the oracle
download webpage. So if you see fetch issues for the oracle java recipes,
then you can overcome the issue by opening the SRCURI links manually in a web
browser, downloading the tarballs, and storing in the bitbake download
location. And the bitbake download location is specified by DL_DIR variable
in build configuration file (conf/local.conf)

Where to Send Patches
=====================

Please substitute "PATCH" with "PATCH v2" if you are submitting a revised version after
addressing feedback (or v3, v4 etc.)
